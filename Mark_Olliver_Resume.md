## Head of IT Operations & DevOps Manager
* Infectious Media Ltd *; Apr 2013 - Jan 2015
Leading DevOps, Data Science and Data in the growing RTA world.
In this role I managed a team of different specialists from Developers and Data Engineer to Analytics and Data Scientists. With them we built, maintained and run a fully scalable RTB product on top of a secure platform of servers. As a team we have scaled the platform in a year from 4000 transactions a second to one capable of over 150,000 transactions per second each analysing many different data points to create the best bid price for the advert and responding to the exchanges 95% of the time in under 10ms. Along with this we also performed real time data warehousing and analytics.
During my time I evaluated our hardware and cloud offerings and migrated our ETL data environment over to using Google's Cloud Services which included heavy use of Big Query. We have found has increased out ETL throughput with many jobs that used to take 20-30 mins using a standard columnar based database now running in 2 mins. It also allowed us due to speed and cost to substantially scale the amounts of data we hold and who within the organization we can allow to access, giving better analytical results.
During the same period we re-engineered our production RTB environment to run over multiple Google Compute zones, which increased performance by nearly 300% and reduced relative cost around 50% whilst allowing us to scale dynamically.

During my time at InfectiousMedia I have grown the role of DevOps Manager within the company, by doing this I have unified the back end data and production teams. As such I now lead a multi skilled discipline of DB Engineers, DevOps Engineers and Data Scientist's. As part of the unification I have also encouraged a strong sense of team work ensuring everyone on the team engages on knowledge sharing.
The other part of my role is one of a more traditional DevOps engineer, where I participate with the development team in regular engineering meetings and production deployments. We now run a solid production and release environment capable of extremely high QPS real time advertising platform. This produces many millions of items of data daily which is then processed by the data parts of my team.
The additional skills I have picked up whilst working here are:
* Hadoop
* Pig
* Python UDF's
* Zookeeper
Along with improving my general programming skills in many languages including Ruby, Python and recently Golang.


## Global Systems Manager
** Thermeon Worldwide **; Jan 2002 - Apr 2013
I am responsible for the running and management of the global systems and infrastructure, including designing a fully redundant colocation grade system with multiple levels of redundancy. My design has included meeting and discussing with suppliers to arrange secure dedicated hosting on multiple continents; arranging contracts with bandwidth providers to ensure tier one connectivity to all sites and an MPLS network between sites. This design included live replication of the data from one site to another and the use of virtual servers, therefore should it be needed we can relocate a live customer from one data centre to another with only a few minutes down time. The design and implementation allowed Thermeon to win a worldwide contract to supply our car rental software to all Hertz Licenses globally.
Some of the tools I have used to run this network are:
* BGP, OSPF, Dynamic Network routing Management
* Fortinet & CISCO Firewalls,
* DRBD. Live disk replication, DRBD Proxy, Worlds first 4 way drbd HA replication
* VirtSH, OpenVZ. XEN, Vmware, VirtualBox, Vagrant and KVM Virtual Servers.
* Linux 64bit and 32bit Systems, including dynamic remote installs.
* Bind, tinydns Domain Name Management
* Sendmail, Postfix, Qmail, SpamAssasin, Email Delivery.
* Vlans, IPSec, pptp, MPLS
* Zabbix, Monit, Nagios, Sensu.
* NodeJS, Bash
* PagerDuty
* Puppet & Chef along with Ruby for scripting and templating.
* Private Cloud, AWS and Rackspace Cloud Environments.
* VOIP, Voice Telephony via IP, Global SIP routing
* GNS3 routing virtualisation.
I assist in customers 1st, 2nd and 3rd line support as needed including on-site trips to customers globally including Ireland, Sweden and Australia, training and trouble shooting issues.
As part of my support to customers I advise them on their networks and computer systems and in some cases act in the capacity of their IT Manager. This has required me to advise on Microsoft Windows Servers, Clients and Cisco networks.


## Systems Tester / Systems Administrator
** Netmonitor / Kertrial Solutions Ltd **; Sep 2000 - Jan 2002
After leaving University I started with Netmonitor who developed software to manage network time pieces. My role initially was to test the software, following strict testing guidelines and procedures. This involved ensuring test systems were often rebuilt to a clean state so that all tests could be followed correctly. The systems we used included Windows and Solaris servers and a mixture of windows and Solaris clients. As I progressed at Netmonitor I moved over to third line support, and systems administration of the network. This involved looking after the test and development hardware, as well as the bespoke customer hardware that we managed. As part of my third line support I travelled to Mexico where I installed and upgraded the monitoring systems of Mexico Telecom.
